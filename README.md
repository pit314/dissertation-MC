# Dissertation-MC 
This GitHub repository contains supplementary material for the submitted dissertation entitled 

"Advancements in Molecular Communication: From Fundamentals to Simulations and Practical Implementations towards Future Research."

More specifically, it contains the Python code (air-based.py) for the channel parameter estimation of the air-based synthetic molecular communication experimental testbed setup.
To run the code, the Python code (air-based.py) only has to be executed. 
A documentation can be found in the Python file itself.
